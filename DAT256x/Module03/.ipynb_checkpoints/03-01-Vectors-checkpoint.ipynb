    "# Vectors\n",
    "Vectors, and vector spaces, are fundamental to *linear algebra*, and they're used in many machine learning models. Vectors describe spatial lines and planes, enabling you to perform calculations that explore relationships in multi-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Vector\n",
    "At its simplest, a vector is a numeric element that has both *magnitude* and *direction*. The magnitude represents a distance (for example, \"2 miles\") and the direction indicates which way the vector is headed (for example, \"East\"). Vectors are defined by an n-dimensional coordinate that describe a point in space that can be connected by a line from an arbitrary origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "That all seems a bit complicated, so let's start with a simple, two-dimensional example. In this case, we'll have a vector that is defined by a point in a two-dimensional plane: A two dimensional coordinate consists of an *x* and a *y* value, and in this case we'll use **2** for *x* and **1** for *y*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our vector can be written as **v**=(2,1), but more formally we would use the following notation, in which the dimensional coordinate values for the vector are shown as a matrix:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\vec{v} = \\begin{bmatrix}2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "So what exactly does that mean? Well, the coordinate is two-dimensional, and describes the movements required to get to the end point (of *head*) of the vector - in this case, we need to move 2 units in the *x* dimension, and 1 unit in the *y* dimension. Note that we don't specify a starting point for the vector - we're simply describing a destination coordinate that encapsulate the magnitide and direction of the vector. Think about it as the directions you need to follow to get to *there* from *here*, without specifying where *here* actually is!\n",
    "\n",
    "It can help to visualize the vector, and with a two-dimensional vector, that's pretty straightforward. We just define a two-dimensional plane, choose a starting point, and plot the coordinate described by the vector relative to the starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code in the following cell to visualize the vector **v** (which remember is described by the coordinate (2,1))."

So the coordinates of our (2,1) vector indicate that we must travel 2 units along the *x* axis, and *1* unit along the *y* axis.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this case, the vector **v** has two components with values **2** and **1**, so our magnitude calculation is:\n",

    " 2. Vector [-2,4] has a negative x and positive y. The line for this vector travels through point 0,0 from quadrant 4 to quadrant 2. Tan<sup>-1</sup> of 4/-2 is around -64.4 degrees, which is the *negative* angle from x to the vector line; but in the wrong direction (as if the vector was travelling from quadrant 2 towards quadrant 4). So we need the opposite direction, which we get by adding 180.\n",
    " 3. Vector [-2,-4] has negative x and y. The line for the vector travels through 0,0 from quadrant 1 to quadrant 3. Tan<sup>-1</sup> of -4/-2 is around 63.4 degrees, which is the angle between the x axis and the line, but again in the opposite direction, from quadrant 3 to quadrant 1; we need to go a further 180 degrees to reflect the correct direction.\n",
    " 4. Vector [2,-4] has positive x and negative y. It travels through 0,0 from quadrant 2 to quadrant 4. Tan<sup>-1</sup> of -4/2 is around -64.4 degrees, which is the *negative* angle from the x axis to the vector line. Technically it's correct, the line is travelleing down and to the right at an angle of -63.4 degrees; but we want to express the *positive* (counter-clockwise) angle, so we add 360.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous Python code, we used the *math.**atan*** function to calculate the inverse tangent from a numeric tangent. The *numpy* library includes a similar ***arctan*** function. When working with numpy arrays, you can also use the *numpy.**arctan2*** function to return the inverse tangent of an array-based vector in *radians*, and you can use the *numpy.**degrees*** function to convert this to degrees. The ***arctan2*** function automatically makes the necessary adjustment for negative *x* and *y* values."
